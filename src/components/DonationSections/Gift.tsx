          We believe that lasting positive change in the world happens when we
          empower young people to lead positive action in their communities â€“
          through Scouting! Scouting has a profound impact on the personal
          development of young people and societies at large. Through our
          life-changing educational programmes, initiatives, and events, we
          equip young people with the skills and knowledge to become active,
          global citizens. Your donation will provide essential training,
          supplies, and educational material in support of Scouting initiatives
          in the areas of peace, equality and sustainable development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Help us reach even more Scouts and expand our impact by making a gift
          to World Scouting today!
